  abstract =  {Product development in the automotive industry is a challenging task for many reasons. There is an ongoing globalization and a constant evolution in the relationships between the OEMs and their suppliers driving an almost constant stream of changes and new challenges to well-established organizations and companies. During a long period of time the automotive industry has established more and more of a mass-customized approach to its business operations. Customers require products to be almost individually tailored to their needs, expectations, and personalized statements. On the other hand, the automotive industry strives minimize costs to be competitive and profitable. Economy of scale from high volumes of common parts is a common approach to minimize product costs. A complementary approach is reuse of existing parts whenever possible. The combination of these factors drives a platform-based approach to product development. The challenge is to maintain a capability to deliver customized products while reducing the number of unique components and design solutions needed for the customization. Modularization and design for variety are approaches to create design solutions that can be used in such an environment to create the appropriate variety using a limited set of component. This thesis argues for the need to introduce more capable product descriptions that can be used by all engineering disciplines and in a cross-functional teamwork during all lifecycle phases of the product. Given the need for product variety the core product definition must include mechanisms to define and manage this variety and enable representation of all relevant product configurations. The main contributions of the research lie in:  definition of the concept of configurable components that are presented as the elements and building blocks capable of providing the foundation for a next generation product description systems,  extension and linkage of existing design theories and methods (e.g. function-means modeling) with the proposed concept of configurable components that extends the current knowledge with mechanisms and methods to deal with variety, and  extension of the concept of configurable components to be used also for manufacturing system modeling with linkage between the product and the manufacturing system models. The research presents an integrated framework for utilizing configurable product and manufacturing system models. The concept of configurable components, the focus on appropriate design bandwidth, and the integrated framework will improve the capability develop high variety and platform-based products with a co-optimization of variety and commonality.},

The objective of Co-platforming is to establish the mapping between platforms of products and manufacturing machines for use in synthesizing systems capable of adaptation to changes in product variants without significant changes in the platform machines. This prolongs manufacturing systems useful life and reduces the cost of re-tooling as products evolve and new models are introduced.

  abstract     = {A platform is commonly used as a basis for generating a number of derivative products, after which it is replaced by a new platform. For some companies, a more viable approach is to adopt a continuous platform that is sustained and expanded over time. This applies to companies that have to provide highly customized products while not in control of interfaces, suppliers in the aerospace industry, for example. For them, the traditional part-based generation of platforms is not sufficient, and more flexibility must be built into the platform. This article proposes an approach for continuous platform development, based on an integrated artifact model and connected development processes. The processes apply set-based concurrent engineering to develop derivative products and to extend the bandwidth of the platform. The artifact model serves as a basis for development and connects products and manufacturing systems to enable informed design decisions that span across the lifecycle. The proposed approach incorporates two modes of platform use. Mode I is applied for configuring products to order within the bandwidth of the platform. This includes automatic concept evaluation using a pallet of computer-aided engineering tools and supporting tools. Mode II is applied when the bandwidth does not suffice to cover the required functionality and therefore needs to be expanded. This article exemplifies the approach through a case from a supplier in the aerospace industry.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Manufacturing companies face increasingly tougher individual customer requirements that force them to revise conceptual solutions for the redesigning of products. This situation limits the reuse of ready-made components and requires physical changes to the manufacturing system. In these settings, platforms must be prepared with greater flexibility to allow development over time. The corresponding platform models need to include conceptual considerations for products and manufacturing systems. The literature advocates functional modeling to capture these considerations but applies it separately to either the product domain or to the manufacturing domain. Further, its relationship to manufacturing processes is not expounded. Thus, functional modeling falls short of its potential to facilitate the integrated development of products and manufacturing systems. This paper puts forth an integrated platform model using functional modeling to capture the conceptual considerations for products and manufacturing systems together with the manufacturing processes. The model is tested for consistency and then illustrated by studying a real case example from the automotive industry modeled according to the approach suggested. The example shows that the model facilitates an understanding of the design of products and their manufacturing systems, including functions shared across domains and across lifecycle phases. Thus, the model is proposed for the conceptual phase of designing, aimed at reusing and redesigning components, machinery, manufacturing processes and design solutions. },

  abstract  = {Companies producing in high-wage countries are increasingly challenged due to the necessary differentiation and cost pressure. The modular product platform approach is more and more used by these companies for structuring their product range in order to realise and deploy commonalities. This type of product architecture enables companies to produce nearly individual products without losing economies of scale across the product range. Economies of scale due to communalities result in decreased process costs, reduced development lead-time by uncoupling the development of modules and products as well as the augmentation of the technical product robustness. However, the design of modular product platforms itself causes new challenges regarding the product structuring, the process and organizational design. Recent approaches for the development of communalities through modular product platforms are focusing only the product itself. Since costs are mainly determined in the development phase but caused later in the production phase both product and production have to be taken into account. Furthermore, modular product platforms have a higher variety and diversity of elements since they represent the components, modules and functions of the entire product program. This paradigm shift from an integral product design to a modular product structure cannot be controlled with existing models and methods.
Our paper confirms commonality has to be optimized by focusing both the product and production. Therefore we have designed a descriptive framework (commonality model) to display and optimize the commonality both in the product and the process. Furthermore, a product architecture development process that is superior to the individual product development processes was developed for the systematic design of commonalities. The approach presented in this paper focusses on the interactions between product and process parameters. In our approach these interactions will first be displayed based on the graph theory and then be optimized applying sensitivity analysis. By varying relevant parameters both on the product and process side constitutive features can be derived determining product and process standards in order to enhance the overall commonality level.},

Searching 36 journals over more than the past 35 years, over 160 references are identified in the engineering and management literature that focus on modularity or commonality in the product and process development context. Each of the references is analyzed along the dimensions subject, effect, and research method. The subjects of these studies have been products, processes, organizations, and even innovations, although the set of references shows a strong preference towards products. Similarly, a broad range of effects has been studied, albeit with the topic cost dominating all other effects. A variety of research methods has been applied to the study of modularity and commonality but the distribution of research methods differs substantially for modularity and commonality research. Despite the wealth of existing research, there are still significant opportunities for future research. In particular, studies that incorporate modularity and commonality's multiple effects on various players along the supply chain, that combine multiple research methods, and that follow systems over time appear very promising.},

  abstract     = {Abstract In today’s global manufacturing environment, changes are inevitable and something that every manufacturer must respond to and take advantage of, whether it is in regards to technology changes, product changes, or changes in the manufacturing processes. The reconfigurable manufacturing system (RMS) meets this challenge through the ability to rapidly and efficiently change capacity and functionality, which is the reason why it has been widely labelled the manufacturing paradigm of the future. However, design of the \{RMS\} represents a significant challenge compared to the design of traditional manufacturing systems, as it should be designed for efficient production of multiple variants, as well as multiple product generations over its lifetime. Thus, critical decisions regarding the degree of scalability and convertibility of the system must be considered in the design phase, which affects the abilities to reconfigure the system in accordance with changes during its operating lifetime. However, in current research it is indicated that conventional manufacturing system design methods do not support the design of an \{RMS\} and that a systematic \{RMS\} design method is lacking, despite the fact that numerous contributions exist. Moreover, there is currently only limited evidence for the breakthrough of reconfigurability in industry. Therefore, the research presented in this paper aims at synthesizing current contributions into a generic method for \{RMS\} design. Initially, currently available design methods for \{RMS\} are reviewed, in terms of classifying and comparing their content, structure, and scope, which leads to a synthesis of the reviewed methods into a generic design method. In continuation of this, the paper includes a discussion of practical implications related to carrying out the design, including an identification of potential challenges and an assessment of which tools that can be applied to support the design. Conclusively, further areas for research are indicated, which provides valuable knowledge of how to develop and realize the benefits of reconfigurability in industry. },

  abstract  = {Set-Based Concurrent Engineering (SBCE) is a comprehensive approach to achieve efficiency in product development by providing guidelines to align the development activities. Given a certain range in a design problem, a set of design solutions is defined. Eliminating infeasible regions gradually narrows the set down to a working solution. Similar to platform-based development, SBCE further aims to reuse design knowledge from past development efforts. Although they share the goal of design reuse, there is a fundamental difference between SBCE and platform-based design. The SBCE design process produces one solution while the creation and use of a platform produces a product family. This paper elaborates an approach for platform concept development. It uses set-based concurrent engineering and its principles to develop a platform based on functions and design solutions while preserving the bandwidth. It shows how function-means trees and trade-off curves can represent solution spaces. Further, these spaces are narrowed down to manageable and desirable size to represent a product platform in line with current technology and available manufacturing capabilities. The approach is illustrated with a case from the aerospace industry showing how a manufacturer of parts for a jet engine can develop comprehensive concepts for a platform. The design space is narrowed down using desired bandwidth and compatibility between design solutions. While the approach has proven feasible in the test case, it requires manufacturing and technology development to produce trade-off curves. This implicitly requires technology development and manufacturing development to precede product development. Alternatively, product development, production development and technology development need to be perfectly coordinated in a concurrent manner.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Formation of product families is of great importance for manufacturing systems which rely on commonality and similarity between products for improving efficiency and productivity. Existing techniques for product family formation are based on similarity measures such as components commonality but none of them consider similarity of the product structure which directly affects the assembly system configuration and the sequence of assembly operations. A novel Bill-of-Materials (BOM) trees matching integer programming model is introduced to address commonality of components as well as their hierarchical assembly structure. A product Bill-of-Materials is a structured tree representing its components and their assembly relationships. \{BOMs\} are traditionally used for Material Requirement Planning (MRP); however, they have other useful applications in product modeling and variety management. A product \{BOM\} trees matching model, inspired by well-established techniques used in the field of biology for comparing phylogenetic trees, has been developed. Hierarchical clustering is applied to form groups of product families based on the pair-wise similarities obtained by matching \{BOM\} trees. The proposed method is applied to a case study of six centrifugal pumps for demonstration and analysis. The benefit of considering structural similarity in family formation for assembly products, in terms of having a better utilized assembly process when compared to the grouping based on plain component commonality, is highlighted. },

In this paper, a participatory design methodology for changeable manufacturing systems is proposed, including requirements specification, selection of appropriate manufacturing paradigm and suitable physical and logical enablers. The methodology supports companies in determining the potential for and mechanisms of transitioning towards changeable manufacturing systems, based on knowledge of products, production, technologies and facilities. The developed methodology is applicable to both new and existing manufacturing systems. It is demonstrated in two industrial cases which highlight its applicability and differences in the appropriate recommended manufacturing systems transition towards changeability as a result of differences in manufacturing characteristics, change requirements and enablers. },

A prerequisite for the implementation is the grouping of parts, which are similar with respect to manufacturing. As an aid to this a classification system based on a form description is introduced. For the machining of this similar parts several manufacturing concepts according to the complexity of the parts have been developed, e.g. machining centres, flow lines and automats. Two case studios are presented. One is the layout of an unlinked flow line, the other one is the utilization of a machining centre.

  abstract     = {Managing product variety is still an issue in the industry and one that gets a lot of attention. Among several ways to address this issue is the development of platforms. Platforms, for instance, coupled with the use of reconfigurable manufacturing systems, can potentially enable manufacturers to deal with a more dynamic market, an increase in variation and decrease in product lifecycle. The development of these platforms and systems is often difficult to begin and even more so to finish. This paper presents a method for developing and codeveloping product and production system platforms, using concepts from the field of software architecture development. Development and implementation of the method were carried out through case studies in two Danish companies. The method is an iterative approach consisting of four loops with four steps each. It facilitates the utilisation of concepts and tools from software architecture development during the platform development process.},

  abstract  = {Manufacturing companies need to satisfy a wide range of customer needs while maintaining manufacturing costs as low as possible, and many are faced with the challenge of providing as much variety as possible for the marketplace with as little variety as possible between products as discussed in Chapter 1. The challenge, then, when designing a family of products is in resolving the tradeoff between product commonality and distinctiveness: if commonality is too high, products lack distinctiveness, and their individual performance is not optimized; on the other hand, if commonality is too low, manufacturing costs can increase substantially (Simpson, et al., 2001). Commonality has many advantages beyond improving economies of scale: decreased lead-time and risk during product development (Collier, 1980); decreased inventory, handling costs and processing time; reduced product line complexity, set-up and retooling time, and increased productivity (Collier, 1979; Collier, 1981). However, too much commonality within a product family can hinder innovation and creativity and even compromise product performance (Krishnan and Gupta, 2001). Commonality is best obtained by minimizing the non-value added variations across the products within a family without limiting the choices of the customers in each market segment, i.e., make each product within a family distinct in ways customers notice and identical in ways that customers cannot see.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the use of platform-based product family design of assembled products has been reconceptualised into a framework of platform-based design of non-assembled products for the process industries. As a point of departure, platform-based design is defined as shared logic in a company's activities, and a “function-based” leveraging strategy is employed to identify non-assembled products with similar characteristics and commonalities among product families, related production processes and raw materials. It is proposed that a production platform philosophy and platform-based design of non-assembled products should rely on Product platforms, Process platforms and Raw-material platforms that are well-integrated into common Production platforms, in an end-to-end perspective. However, platform-based design of non-assembled products may differ depending on whether company production relies solely on a captive raw material base or on purchased raw materials on the open market, or on both. The congruence of the development of Production platforms with the QFD methodology and House of Quality was noted in this study, as well as the simplicity of using the methodology on homogeneous products compared to multi-level hierarchical assembled products. It is argued that the proposed conceptual framework can be used in internal company discussions and reviews whether and how such an approach in product innovation can be a fruitful avenue to explore and adapt.},

Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines.

However, increasing demand for speed and cost-effectiveness motivates a more holistic and integrated approach to new product introductions which do not only consider product design. Thus, needs exist for extending the scope of architecture and platform development to cover production aspects and thereby improving the robust process design capability of mass customization. Although attention to production architectures and production platforms has increased lately, not much has been published within this research area. Furthermore, empirical observations show that current vocabulary and detail level of constructs, models and methods for developing production platforms are not sufficient for proper industrial application---they need to be put into context. With origin in software architecture research, this paper provides a conceptual model that sets the context of creating production platform architectures.},

  abstract     = {The demand for delivering product variety has been increasing. Increased product variety caused by product customization, personalization, evolution and changes in their manufacturing systems. Variety allows manufacturers to satisfy a wide range of customer requirements, but it can also be a major contributing factor to increased complexity of assembly. Complexity is generally believed to be one of the main causes of the present challenges in manufacturing systems such as lengthy and costly design processes, higher life cycle costs and the existence of numerous failure modes. Complex assembly systems are costly to implement, run, control and maintain. Assessing complexity of assembly helps guides designers in creating assembly-oriented product designs and following steps to reduce and manage sources of assembly complexity. On the other hand, reducing complexity of assembly helps lower assembly cost and time, improves productivity and quality and increases profitability and competitiveness. The complexity of assembly should be assessed by considering both products and their assembly systems. In this paper, a structural classification coding scheme has been used to measure assembly systems complexity. It considers the inherent structural complexity of typical assembly equipment. The derived assembly systems complexity accounts for the number, diversity and information content within each class of the assembly system modules. A domestic appliance drive assembly system is used to demonstrate the use of the classification code to calculate the assembly system complexity. The developed complexity metrics can be used by designers as decision support tools to compare and rationalize various automated assembly systems alternatives and select the design that meets the requirements while reducing potential assembly complexity and associated cost.},

  abstract     = {Product platforms have proven efficient as a means to reduce lead-time and increase product quality simultaneously. When using platforms to generate a family of products, the number of variants that need to be managed in manufacturing increases. To succeed with this, the manufacturing system needs to be maintained in a similar level of flexibility as the product platform. However, there is seldom a joint decision behind each and every conceptual product variant during development, regarding capability in manufacturing. For example, when considering producibility, some product variants require better tolerances than what the manufacturing processes can deliver. This uncertainty can be reduced, by making producibility analyses of a set of conceptual product variants. By performing several different analyses, knowledge can be gained, and joint decisions can be made about cross product-manufacturing aspects. The activities can be systematically arranged to gradually eliminate unfeasible conceptual product variants. In this paper we show how an integrated PLM architecture can be used to create sufficient knowledge as a basis for joint product and manufacturing decisions. The utmost company benefit of this is to reduce lead-time by taking manufacturing capability into account when developing product families.},

  abstract     = {Development of platforms for products has proven a successful way to manage and address several challenges related to increasing variety and accelerating product development cycles. Thus, it is natural to assume that platforms may facilitate similar benefits for manufacturing systems, as they are both technical systems. Production and manufacturing systems platform development is, however, still an area of research lacking maturity. Development of platforms in this field comes with a set of challenges not necessarily found in product platform development. Looking towards other fields of research or science may be necessary to address these challenges. This paper aims to study challenges related to production and manufacturing systems platform development and describe how these have been addressed. It does so through an evolving case study based on four projects with an industrial collaborator. This leads to setting the stage for future research on production platforms.},

  abstract     = {The philosophy of group technology (GT) is an important concept in the design of flexible manufacturing systems and manufacturing cells. Group technology is a manufacturing philosophy that identifies similar parts and groups them into families. Beside assigning unique codes to these parts, group technology developers intend to take advantage of part similarities during design and manufacturing processes. GT is not the answer to all manufacturing problems, but it is a good management technique with which to standardize efforts and eliminate duplication. Group technology classifies parts by assigning them to different families based on their similarities in: (1) design attributes (physical shape and size), and/or (2) manufacturing attributes (processing sequence). The manufacturing industry today is process focused; departments and sub units are no longer independent but are interdependent. If the product development process is to be optimized, engineering and manufacturing cannot remain independent any more: they must be coordinated. Each sub-system is a critical component within an integrated manufacturing framework. The coding and classification system is the basis of CAPP and the functioning and reliability of CAPP depends on the robustness of the coding system. The proposed coding system is considered superior to the previously proposed coding systems, in that it has the capability to migrate into multiple manufacturing environments. This article presents the design of a coding and classification system and the supporting database for manufacturing processes based on both design and manufacturing attributes of parts. An interface with the spreadsheet will calculate the machine operation costs for various processes. This menu-driven interactive package is implemented using dBASE-IV. Part Family formation is achieved using a KAMCELL package developed in TURBO Pascal.},

Changeable manufacturing, encompassing reconfigurability and flexibility, provides a mechanisms for addressing these new demands, however there is a significant gap between the concept of changeable manufacturing, and what is actually enabled through operational methods. This paper analyzes how integrated modelling of products and processes can be applied when designing, managing, and operating changeable manufacturing systems. This is structured using generic changeability classes and generic changeability enablers. It is concluded that integrated product-process modelling has a potential to support changeability, especially within the classes reconfigurability, flexibility and transformability. However a theory-practice gap still exists, calling for more research on specific methods and feasibility of such approach.},

  abstract  = {Production platforms present an attractive solution to managing increasing product variety in production systems. Forming production systems platforms can potentially facilitate changeable manufacturing and co-development of products and production systems. One of the first steps in developing a production platform is the identification of the potential candidates. A scheme for classification coding of production systems is presented. Coded production systems can be compared across a manufacturer’s departments in order to identify commonalities between systems, and thus identify candidates for platform development. The production system classification code consists of four sub-codes with four to ten digits each describing physical or logical characteristics on production system or cell levels. The four sub-codes are structured into blocks of classification code, which digitally represent and describe complete production systems. They facilitate the comparison and identification of similarity and commonality patterns using the code digits and values. A production system case study is used for illustration and is represented as a block of code following the developed coding scheme. The production systems classification code can be used as a decision support tool in the early phases of production systems platform development, and for capturing information on the rationale, structure, processes and enablers of flexible and changeable production systems.},

The characteristics of the two paradigms are outlined and compared. The concept of manufacturing system life cycle is presented. The main types of flexibility in manufacturing systems are discussed and contrasted with the various reconfiguration aspects including hard (physical) and soft (logical) reconfiguration. The types of changeability and transformability of manufacturing systems, their components as well as factories, are presented along with their enablers and compared with flexibility and reconfigurability. The importance of having harmonized human-machine manufacturing systems is highlighted and the role of people in the various manufacturing paradigms and how this varies in pursuit of productivity are illustrated.

Such manufacturing systems are complicated to develop, and it can be advantageous to base or build these systems on product and production platforms. Development of platforms is, however, not a trivial task. Currently, identification and selection of candidates for inclusion in a platform is typically subjective relying on experts and tacit knowledge. The objectivity of this process can be strengthened by collecting data on existing production systems in a company and comparing these systems to each other. To do so, a coherent, consistent and preferably digital representation of multiple production systems is needed. In this research, a production system classification coding (PSCC) scheme is employed to classify and structure data for a number of existing production systems, spanning multiple departments and product families. Candidates for a production platform covering the included production systems are identified based on ranking certain platform drivers, processes and enablers.},

The layout of manufacturing systems determines its structural complexity by virtue of its design configuration characteristics. This paper introduces a new model and indices for assessing the structural complexity of manufacturing systems layout in the physical domain. Six complexity indices, based on the physical structural characteristics of the layout, have been introduced and formulated. They are layout density, path, cycle, decision points, redundancy distribution and magnitude indices. An overall Layout Complexity Index (LCI) which combines all indices is developed using a novel method based on radar plots which is insensitive to the order of plotting the individual indices. The use of the developed LCI is demonstrated using six typical types of manufacturing systems layouts and relevant guidelines are presented. The developed model and complexity indices help design system layouts for least complexity and compare layout alternatives that meet the specifications, at early design stages. It supports making trade-off decisions regarding manufacturing systems flexibility and complexity and their associated costs.},

We describe an open marketplace, where product sellers can offer their products with variability, end customers can configure these for their needs, and factories can offer their services to manufacture these customized products. Typically, the equipment used to build up the factory also offers variability; therefore the ecosystem also encompasses equipment vendors and the variability of this equipment. We attempt to bring together stakeholders of a production ecosystem in a marketplace that exploits product line engineering techniques.},

It is crucial to consider the resources’ individual lifecycle, their actual capabilities and condition during the system design and reconfiguration.

The Global Manufacturing Revolution is the first book to focus on these issues. Based on the author's long-standing course work at the University of Michigan, this unique volume proposes new technologies and new business strategies that can increase an enterprise's speed of responsiveness to volatile markets, as well as enhance the integration of its own engineering and business.
Introduced here are innovations to the entire manufacturing culture:
* An original approach to the analysis of manufacturing paradigms
* Suggested methods for developing creativity in product design
* A quantitative analysis of manufacturing system configurations
* A new manufacturing "reconfigurable" paradigm, in which the speed of responsiveness is the prime business goal
* An original approach to using information technology for workforce empowerment
The book also offers analysis and original models of previous manufacturing paradigms' technical and business dimensions—including mass production and mass customization—in order to fully explain the current revolution in global manufacturing enterprises. In addition, 200 original illustrations and pictures help to clarify the topics.
Globalization is creating both opportunities and challenges for companies that manufacture durable goods. The tools, theories, and case studies in this volume will be invaluable to engineers pursuing leadership careers in the manufacturing industry, as well as to leaders of global enterprises and business students who are motivated to lead manufacturing enterprises and ensure their growth.},

  abstract     = {Purpose
Success in manufacturing industries often depends on the ability of a firm to apply product platforms. In speeding up product development, platforms often enable companies to benefit from scale effects by reusing existing components in the development of new products. In the delivery of complex products and system (CoPS), however, platforms are frequently modified since components have to be changed within their life cycle to meet additional customer-specific engineering demands and evolving innovations in technology. In this article, it will be illustrated that intangible design elements can be used as platforms in firms that deliver CoPS. The paper aims to discuss these issues.

Design/methodology/approach
Through extensive fieldwork at a leading supplier of science-based lithography machinery, a modified platform concept was developed and tested that is labelled as the function-technology (FT) platform. The longitudinal data, collected on site, demonstrate positive effects of applying FT platforms.

Findings
The results show that an important explanation for firm's success in delivering lithography machinery with attractive performance is their ability to deliver variants that are specific in terms of physical modules, but common in terms of functions and technologies. Based on the results, it can be argued that establishing an FT platform will allow the efficient creation of variants within a family of CoPS.

Originality/value
The findings add considerable insight to the existing literature on operations management by explaining how intangible design elements, instigated during development, can be reused in the delivery of CoPS. Moreover, it enables development managers to more easily structure and reuse complex development tasks.},

  abstract = {Assembly is the capstone process for product realization where component parts and subassemblies are integrated together to form the final products. As product variety increases due to the shift from mass production to mass customization, assembly systems must be designed and operated to handle such high variety. In this paper we first review the state of the art research in the areas of assembly system design, planning and operations in the presence of product variety. Methods for assembly representation, sequence generation and assembly line balancing are reviewed and summarized. Operational complexity and the role of human operators in assembly systems are then discussed in the context of product variety. Challenges in disassembly and remanufacturing in the presence of high variety are presented. We then conjecture a future manufacturing paradigm of personalized products and production and discuss the assembly challenge for such a paradigm. Opportunities for assembly system research are summarized at the end of the paper.},
