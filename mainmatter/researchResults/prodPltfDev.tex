\chapter{Developing Manufacturing System Platforms}\label{chp:prodPltfDev}
In order to demonstrate the progress made within the field of manufacturing system platforms, this chapter accounts for the scientific contribution of each of the six appended, peer-reviewed papers.
To illustrate the progress and development of the research as it was carried out, the papers are organised in chronological order of writing.
As outlined in \cref{sec:RQ}, each paper covers one or more sub-questions, each contributing to addressing the three main research questions for this thesis.

The following sections are based on the six appended papers, and will include an extended abstract for each paper.
As such, some level of similarity and repetition of certain results, arguments, figures, and phrasings is to be expected.
