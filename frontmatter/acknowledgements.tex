Firstly, my supervisors \AProf{} Thomas D. Brunø and \AProf{} Kjeld Nielsen.
You believed in me enough to give me this opportunity, and for that I am forever grateful.
The support, guidance, and inspiration you have given me over the last three years have been invaluable.
And to my colleagues in the Mass Customization research group, I couldn't have dreamed of a better environment to work these past three years. 

My gratitude  goes out to \Prof{} Hoda A.\ ElMaraghy and \Prof{} Waguih ElMaraghy.
Thank you for welcoming me at the Intelligent Manufacturing System Centre at University of Windsor and sharing your knowledge with me.
It has been my honour to work with you, and your insight contributed significantly to the progress of my research.
In the same breath, I would like to thank the researchers at the Intelligent Manufacturing Systems Lab.
You helped make my stay enjoyable.

I would also like to thank Bjørn Langeland, chief engineer, for taking part in and helping me conduct this research with the industry.
We've had many long discussions throughout the years this research has taken place.
My acknowledgement also goes out to the Manufacturing Academy of Denmark (MADE) for giving me the opportunity to conduct this research.

Finally, I owe my family and friends more than words can express.
I would not have made it through this process without your support and help. 
A special mention and my heartfelt gratitude to Sofie Bech and Nikolai Øllegaard.
Thank you for being there for me through all of this.
For sharing my joy when things went right, for pulling me back up when I was down, and distracting me when I needed it.
I know I haven't always been easy to deal with, but you were always there for me.
Thank you for all the good times, and for everything that's come.
