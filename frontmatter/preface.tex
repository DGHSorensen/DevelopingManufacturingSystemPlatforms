\chapter*{Preface}\label{acknow}\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface}
If you've ever read the preface and acknowledgements section of a \PhD{} thesis before, you already know what's coming in this one.
They always talk about the amount of work being put into the thesis, the personal achievement it is to finish a work such as this, the many hours spent alone doing research, writing papers and finally the thesis.
Often, they will also talk about the author's motivation for starting this gruelling process, because what actually does motivate a person to go through this voluntarily?
We'll get back to that in a second.

The preface, acknowledgements or equivalent will \emph{always} talk about and thank a lot of people for their direct or indirect help with the thesis, the project and the papers.
In many ways, this preface will be no different.
But this is definitely a section I have been looking forward to writing.
I have been looking forward to putting the finishing touches on my thesis, of course, and thanking all the people who helped me along the way.
Credit where credit's due.

Having spent countless hours pouring over minor details just in the layout and setup of the thesis template, it has been a joy seeing the pages fill---sometimes slowly, sometimes fast---and everything just working.
But part of it, is also that I consider this one section of my thesis to be sort of a free space; a place where I can just write (almost) what comes to mind.
And truth be told, that is incredibly refreshing.
If you've read or written academic papers or theses before, you'll know that the language used in these kinds of things is something quite its own.
In this free space, I'm slightly less bound by scientific customs, terms and formality.
I can speak more directly to you.

Let's get back to the bit about motivation.
I started at Aalborg University in 2011, choosing mechanical engineering because it sounded right up my alley, and Aalborg University seemed like a perfect fit.
Lots of work in groups, projects focused on solving actual problems and applying actual solutions.
It wasn't easy by any means, but I liked it a lot---the subjects, the people and the university.
I didn't really find \emph{my} area of interest until the second semester of my Master's degree in 2015 where I had the first project on platforms.
It just clicked.
This was something I was good at, something I understood, something that interested me, and I was not about to let it go.
So for the following two last semesters, I kept working with platforms.
Building up more knowledge, coming up with new ideas for things to work on in relation to platforms.
By the end of it, I was worn out---a Master's thesis is not easy to write either.
Truth be told, the last thing I was considering at that point in time was doing a \PhD{}.
I decided I was done with the university and had to get out, at least for a little bit.
But then I was asked whether I wanted to do a \PhD{}, and after carefully considering it for a few months as I defended my Master's thesis and watched my friends do the same, I decided this was something I couldn't turn down.

And I do not regret it in the least.
Of course it didn't turn out exactly the way I'd imagined it, I don't think it ever really does, but it has definitely been an experience I wouldn't have been without.
I've met so many amazing people along the way, travelled to new places, learned so much and I've become a better person for it. 

So if you come across this thesis---whether it is in your search for knowledge, out of obligation because someone handed you a copy, if you find it buried on some shelf somewhere, or simply blindly grabbing \emph{something} to read---I hope you find it useful, interesting or at the very least, a way to kill a few hours.
Because all things considered and despite the bad times, I have had a blast working on this thesis and I \emph{am} proud of my work, this thesis being one of my bigger personal achievements so far.
And with that, before we head into the actual thesis, I have a few people I want to thank.
